# ChatGPT Integration Testing Guide

## ✅ ChatGPT is Now Connected!

Your OpenAI API key has been configured and integrated into the chatbot's main AI engine (`smartAI.ts`).

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Property Questions** → Local AI (Fast & Free)
```
User: "I earn 5000 and have 2 kids"
→ Local AI: Calculates budget, infers 3+ bedrooms, shows properties
→ Response time: <100ms
→ Cost: $0.00
```

### 2. **Non-Property Questions** → ChatGPT (Natural & Smart)
```
User: "What's the weather like?"
→ ChatGPT: Generates natural response
→ Relates it to property search smoothly
→ Response time: 1-2 seconds
→ Cost: ~$0.002
```

---

## Test Scenarios

### ✅ Test 1: Property Search (Should Use Local AI)

Try these - they should be FAST and show properties:

```
"I earn RM 6000 and have a family of 4"
→ Should calculate budget and show 3+ bedroom properties

"Looking for condos in KL under RM 800k"
→ Should filter and show matching properties

"Show me houses with pool in Johor"
→ Should show properties with pool amenity
```

**Expected:** Instant responses (<100ms), properties shown

---

### ✅ Test 2: General Chat (Should Use ChatGPT)

Try these - they should be CONVERSATIONAL and natural:

```
"What's the weather like today?"
→ Should give natural weather response + relate to properties

"Tell me about good food in Penang"
→ Should discuss food + suggest properties near food areas

"What movies are playing?"
→ Should respond naturally + mention entertainment-friendly properties

"How's the traffic in KL?"
→ Should discuss traffic + suggest properties with good access
```

**Expected:** Natural conversation (1-2 sec delay), smooth transition to properties

---

### ✅ Test 3: Context Awareness (ChatGPT Remembers)

Try this sequence:

```
Step 1: "I'm looking for properties in Johor"
→ Local AI extracts location

Step 2: "What's the weather like there?"
→ ChatGPT should reference "Johor" and relate to property search

Step 3: "Show me some options"
→ Should remember Johor preference and show properties
```

**Expected:** ChatGPT maintains context across conversation

---

## How to Verify ChatGPT is Working

### Option 1: Check Browser Console

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Ask a non-property question like "What's the weather?"
4. Look for:
   - ✅ No errors
   - ✅ Network request to `api.openai.com`
   - ✅ Response with natural text

### Option 2: Response Quality

**Without ChatGPT** (fallback):
```
User: "What's the weather?"
Bot: "Weather's been pretty typical for Malaysia - hot and humid!
      If you're property hunting, I can help you find places with
      great ventilation..."
```
(Generic, templated response)

**With ChatGPT** (active):
```
User: "What's the weather?"
Bot: "It's been quite hot and humid lately, typical Malaysian weather!
      Since you mentioned looking for properties in Johor earlier,
      you might want to consider places with good cross-ventilation
      or air conditioning. Want me to filter for those features?"
```
(Natural, context-aware, personalized)

### Option 3: Check API Usage

1. Visit: https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. Ask several non-property questions in your chat
3. Refresh the usage page
4. You should see API calls logged

## What Questions Use ChatGPT?

### ✅ Uses ChatGPT (Non-Property)

- Weather questions: "How's the weather?", "Is it raining?"
- Food questions: "Good restaurants in KL?", "Best food areas?"
- Entertainment: "What movies are playing?", "Good cinemas?"
- Transportation: "How's the traffic?", "Best way to commute?"
- General: "Tell me a joke", "How are you?", "What's new?"
- Lifestyle: "Best gyms?", "Good schools?", "Sports facilities?"

### ❌ Doesn't Use ChatGPT (Property-Related)

- Property search: "Show me condos", "Looking for houses"
- Budget: "Under RM 500k", "I earn 5000"
- Location: "In Johor", "Near KL", "Penang area"
- Features: "With pool", "3 bedrooms", "Parking"
- Intent: "Want to buy", "Looking to rent"

## Response Flow Diagram

```
User Message
    ↓
Is it a greeting? → YES → Local response (fast)
    ↓ NO
Is it a joke? → YES → Local response (fast)
    ↓ NO
Is it property-related? → YES → Local AI (fast + shows properties)
    ↓ NO
Non-property question → ChatGPT API (1-2 sec + natural response)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: All responses seem generic/templated

**Cause:** ChatGPT might not be initializing

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env` file has: `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify API key is valid at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Issue: ChatGPT responses are slow

**Cause:** This is normal - API calls take 1-2 seconds

**Expected behavior:**
- Property questions: <100ms (local)
- General questions: 1-2 sec (ChatGPT)

### Issue: Getting API errors

**Possible causes:**
- Invalid API key
- No billing/credits on OpenAI account
- Rate limit exceeded
- Network issues

**Fix:**
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Check billing at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
3. Ensure you have credits available
4. Check browser console for specific error

## Cost Management

### Current Setup

- **Model:** GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Cost:** ~$0.002 per conversation
- **Max tokens:** 150 per response (keeps costs low)

### Monthly Estimates

| Users/Day | Non-Property Questions/Day | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 10        | 20                        | ~$1.20       |
| 50        | 100                       | ~$6.00       |
| 100       | 200                       | ~$12.00      |
| 500       | 1,000                     | ~$60.00      |

### Cost Saving Tips

1. **Most questions use free local AI** - only off-topic uses ChatGPT
2. **150 token limit** - keeps responses concise and cheap
3. **Smart detection** - only non-property questions use API
4. **Fallback system** - if API fails, uses free local responses
